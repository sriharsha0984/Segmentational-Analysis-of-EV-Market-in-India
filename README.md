Segmentational Analysis on EV startup in INDIA
We have seen massive changes, particularly in terms of technology, but also in terms of people’s attitude towards cars’ environmental impacts and other mobility solutions, from the first electric car established in 1837 up to the present time. Although the electric vehicle market is currently a lucrative goal for companies and start-ups in India, several obstacles still remain to be addressed in order for EVs to be ready for mass adoption. 
Electronic Electric OEMs already in the Indian market have a great deal to do with post-sales service issues. Battery packs are assured for several years, whilst the service networks are fitted with technicians who are specially qualified to welcome and manage an EV. Wall charging units are often built at the chosen customers’ location by several producers without any extra expense.
